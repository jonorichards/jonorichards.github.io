Work in progress**
Hello I'm Jono, a Sound Designer, Creative Technologist and Community Arts Practitioner based in Sheffield UK.
I provide sound and technology for installations, games, commercials, sample libraries, film and theatre projects. As an arts practitioner, I offer workshop sessions as well as bespoke technical solutions with a focus on accessibility.

I am experienced in both audio and visual system design using tools such as MaxMSP, Unreal/Wwise and TouchDesigner. I have over 25 years experience in studio technology and techniques, having worked as a [solo artist](https://soundcloud.com/johnnysideways) and collaborator on many projects. Throughout this time I have worked with numerous teams and professionals across multiple disciplines in the arts.

I would love to hear about your project, perhaps we could work together..

Here are some of my key tools and skills:

* Max MSP
* Touch Designer
* Unreal Engine
* Wwise
