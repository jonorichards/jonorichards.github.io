## About Me

![](/images/jono/me_modular_rs.jpg)

Hello I'm Jono, a Sound Designer, Creative Technologist and Community Arts Practitioner based in Sheffield, UK.
I provide sound and technology for a range of [applications](https://jonorichards.github.io) from art installations to video games and much inbetween. As an arts practitioner, I offer workshop sessions as well as bespoke technical solutions with a focus on accessibility.

I have a background in music production spanning over 25 years, having worked as a [solo artist](https://soundcloud.com/johnnysideways) and collaborator on many projects. Throughout this time I have worked with numerous teams and professionals across multiple disciplines in the arts.

 In 2023 I received an [MSc in Sound & Music for Interactive Games](https://leedsbeckett.ac.uk/courses/sound-music-interactive-games-msc/) with Distiction from Leeds Beckett University. This led to my current development in interactive and immersive media. I am now applying the skills gained through working with games to adjacent areas such as [Immersive Installations](https://jonorichards.github.io/project/andbreathe) and [Accessible Technology](https://jonorichards.github.io/project/vjinterface). I am proficient in audio and visual system design using tools such as MaxMSP, Unreal/Wwise and TouchDesigner and have a broad audio skillset.

I am open for commissions and collaborations. Please get in touch if you would like to work together.
