## And..Breathe


I was recently commissioned by [Pif-Paf Theatre](https://pif-paf.co.uk) to help develop an interactive sound and light installation called [And..Breathe](https://pif-paf.co.uk/portfolio/and-breath).

It explores breath, breathing alone and breathing together, mixing science and the raw joy of playing together. A tactile piece that encourages interaction and mindfulness.

A public prototype was shown at [Otherham Winter Light Festival](https://fluxrotherham.org.uk/otherham-winter-light-festival-2025/) in January 2025 and the piece premiered a month later at [Illuminate - Light Night](https://hla.oldham.gov.uk/illuminate/) in Oldham. The production is now touring across the UK.

To develop the tech for this project I made use of TouchDesigner, Ableton Live and Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers. I used sensor data from public interaction with the 6 zones of play to affect changes in both sound and light at each zone, as well as globally across its architecture. The beautiful wooden structure (made from bent Ash) was crafted by the amazing Pete Gunson, with whom I also worked closely on the hardware implementation. The interactive soundtrack was produced by Eleanor Hooper who also worked with me on it's implementation.
