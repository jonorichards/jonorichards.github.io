## Brownie's Adventure - The Final Resolution

I'm currently contracted by [Beardy Ramblin' Games](https://richbrown.uk/brg) here in Sheffield to provide sound design and audio mixing for an upcoming adventure game.
The game is the third part of a trilogy featuring the comedic adventures of Brownie, a Wizard of dubious talent.
Based partly in Sheffield/The Peak District and partly in a magical dimention, a bit like me really..it's been a lot of fun to work on!
As a veteran Point & Click Adventure fan, it's a real treat to be working on this project, for the nostalgia and to be working alongside the talented  [Rich Brown](https://richbrown.uk).
The demo is now available to play on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3424080/Brownies_Adventure_The_Final_Resolution_Demo) and the full game is set for release in Winter 2025.

Shortly after the release of the demo, we recieved quite a bit of press, the most noteworthy being a feature on [BBC News](https://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrzdpdzqv0o)
