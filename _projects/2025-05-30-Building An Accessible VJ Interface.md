Through my creative sessional work with disabled artists at [Under The Stars](https://underthestars.org.uk/) I co-developed an assessible VJ system for workshop participants to use at gigs and their regular nightclub events. The project was realised over several months, while iterating and testing it with the group. This project has been a great success, allowing those who would not usually have access to this kind of technology to improvise thier own unique visual content along with music.

The system has now been used at numerous events such as [Tramlines Festival](https://tramlines.org.uk), gigs at [Yellow Arch Studios](https://yellowarch.com) and the organisations own bi-monthly nightclub at [The Leadmill](https://leadmill.co.uk). 

In April 2025 we were invited to the [Crux - Festival of Audiovisual Arts](https://festival.crux-events.org) to showcase our project along with the fastastic [Drake Music](https://drakemusic.org).

I documented the whole project and put together a video for Under The Stars to showcase our development process, you can watch it here.
