## And..Breathe


I was recently commissioned by [Pif-Paf Theatre co.](https://pif-paf.co.uk) to help develop an interactive sound and light installation called [And..Breathe](https://pif-paf.co.uk/portfolio/and-breath).

It explores breath, breathing alone and breathing together, mixing science and the raw joy playing together. A tactile piece that encourages interaction and mindfulness.

Collaboraating on this project I made use of TouchDesigner, Ableton Live and the Arduino and ESP32 microcontrollers. I utilised sensor data from public interaction with the 6 zones of play throughout the structure, which in turn affect changes in both sound and light at each zone and globally across its architecture.
