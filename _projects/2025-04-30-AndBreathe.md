## And..Breathe


I was recently commissioned by [Pif-Paf Theatre](https://pif-paf.co.uk) to help develop an interactive sound and light installation called [And..Breathe](https://pif-paf.co.uk/portfolio/and-breath).

It explores breath, breathing alone and breathing together, mixing science and the raw joy playing together. A tactile piece that encourages interaction and mindfulness.

Collaborating on this project I made use of TouchDesigner, Ableton Live and Arduino/ESP32 microcontrollers. I utilised sensor data from public interaction with the 6 zones of play throughout the structure, which in turn affect changes in both sound and light at each zone as well as globally across its architecture.

A public prototype was shown at [Otherham Winter Light Festival](https://fluxrotherham.org.uk/otherham-winter-light-festival-2025/) in January 2025 and the piece premiered a month later at [Illuminate - Light Night](https://hla.oldham.gov.uk/illuminate/) in Oldham. And..Breathe is now touring across the UK.
