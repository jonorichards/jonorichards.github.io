## Brownie's Adventure - The Final Resolution

I'm currently working with [Beardy Ramblin' Games](https://richbrown.uk/brg) here in Sheffield to provide sound design and audio mixing for an upcoming adventure game.
The game is the third part of a trilogy featuring the comedic adventures of Brownie, a wizard of dubious talent.
Based partly in Sheffield/The Peak District and partly in a magical dimension, a bit like me really.. it's been a lot of fun to work on!
As a veteran Point & Click Adventure fan, it's a real treat to be working on this project; for the nostalgia and to be working alongside the talented  [Rich Brown](https://richbrown.uk).

Due to the game's regional focus, we received quite a bit of press, the most noteworthy being an article on the [BBC News](https://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crrzdpdzqv0o) website as well as an additional feature on BBC Radio Derby.

The demo is now available to play on the popular gaming platform [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3424080/Brownies_Adventure_The_Final_Resolution_Demo) and the full game is set for release in Winter 2025.
