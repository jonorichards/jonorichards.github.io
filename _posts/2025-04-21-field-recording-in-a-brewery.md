## Field Recording In A Brewery

A few summers ago my friend and collaborator [Josh Foers](https://www.joshfoersgameaudio.co.uk/) and I had the unique oportunity to record in a craft brewery here in Sheffield. As you can hear, we managed to capture some excellent material which we have both made use of in various projects since.

This lovely little video was originally posted on Twitter. The less said about that platform the better, but needless to say, i'm no longer using it. It seemed a shame to lose a nice bit of documentation like this so here it is for posterity.
