## Building a Website

Hi! Kicking off this blog with a quick note about the site. I'd been needing somewhere to document my projects for some time, having quite a range of projects to showcase. In the past when i was working predominently as a musician, I focussed on Facebook and Soundcloud as a means of promoting my work. These days my projects are really varied, so I hope to put them all in one place. 

Having no web development experience but wanting autonomy from the various cut & paste design and hosting services, I found out that it is possible to host your own static website as a Github repo..for free! This seemed like a no-brainer since it would give me the aforementioned autonomy i desired as well as demonstrating my ability to use Github without me explicity having to say so, due to the free 'github.io' handle.

After installing [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jeyll](https://jekyllrb.com) in the command line, I set up a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) site and installed a basic Jekyll portfolio theme. Having customised the layout and settings I then proceeded to fill out the various sections with my projects and other info using Markdown formatting.

It's been really nice going through some of these pieces of work again, reflecting on how much i've learnt since. In addition to the project page, I aim to use this blog to document all the additional leearning and experiments that don't fall into the 'project' catagory.. I'm always learning something new, which will hopefully be of interest to others!

Cheers
J
