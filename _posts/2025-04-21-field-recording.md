## Field Recording

Field recording is something I've experimented with since I had a tape recorder as a child. Quite randomly I was exposed to the work of Brain Eno in my teens and a fascination with ambient music..and sound more generally, began.

Growing up in North Yorkshire and now residing in Sheffield, I've always been lucky to have access to the outdoors. The Peak District is a brilliant place to record the sounds of nature, as long as you're willing to time your visits to minimise extranious noise from people, cars and planes.

I am a member of the [Wildlife Recording Society](https://www.wildlife-sound.org/), a valuable source of expertise, and the Field Recording Slack group remains a constant source of inspiration. I contributed to a crowd-sourced [Sound Library](https://frscharity.org/Water_and_Ice/) they organised in spring 2022. The library is available in return for donations to Doctors Without Borders, The Red Cross and Unicef.

It's also great fun to find and record unusual objects, and I'm always on the hunt for things that produce interesting tones and textures.

These sounds make ideal source material that can be combined and further manipulated using software.

A few summers ago my friend and collaborator [Josh Foers](https://www.joshfoersgameaudio.co.uk/) and I had the unique oportunity to record in a craft brewery here in Sheffield. As you can hear, we managed to capture some excellent material which we have both made use of in various projects since.

We've continued to record in some great locations together, such as the historic Braime metal factory in Leeds.

I use a range of mics for different situations, such as the tiny Lom - Usi Pro, a Rode shotgun and various contact mics. However, more often than not I reach for my trusty hand-held [Sony PCM D100](https://www.sony.com/lr/electronics/voice-recorders/pcm-d100). Simply put, it's convenient and sounds amazing. The reduced setup time of a hand-held compared to more elaborate rigs means you're less likely to miss those fleeting but golden recording oportunities..
