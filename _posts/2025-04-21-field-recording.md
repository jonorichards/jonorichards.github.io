## Field Recording

Field recording is something I've experimented with since I had a tape recorder as a child. Quite randomly I was exposed to the work of Brain Eno in my teens and a fascination with ambient music..and sound more generally, began.

Growing up in North Yorkshire and now residing in Sheffield, I've always been lucky to have access to the outdoors. The Peak District is a brilliant place to record the sounds of nature, as long as you're willing to time your visits to minimise extranious noise from people, cars and planes.

In the spring of 2022 I contributed to a crowd-sourced [Sound Library](https://https://frscharity.org/Water_and_Ice/) organised by the Field Recording Slack group. The library is available in return for donations to Doctors Without Borders, The Red Cross and Unicef.

It's also great fun to find and record unusual objects, and I'm always on the hunt for things that produce interesting tones and textures.

These sounds make ideal source material for combining and further manipulating using software plug-ins.













A few summers ago my friend and collaborator [Josh Foers](https://www.joshfoersgameaudio.co.uk/) and I had the unique oportunity to record in a craft brewery here in Sheffield. As you can hear, we managed to capture some excellent material which we have both made use of in various projects since.

We've continued to record in some great locations together, such as the historic Braime metal factory in Leeds.
