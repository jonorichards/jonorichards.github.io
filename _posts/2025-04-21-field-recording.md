## Field Recording

Field recording is something I've experimented with since I had a tape recorder as a child. Quite randomly I was exposed to the work of Brain Eno in my teens and a fascination with ambient music..and sound more generally, began.

Growing up in North Yorkshire and now residing in Sheffield, I've always been lucky to have access to the outdoors. The Peak District is a brilliant place to record the sounds of nature, as long as you're willing to time your visits to minimise extranious noise from people, cars and planes.

As well as using these sounds in my own projects, I contributed to a crowd-sourced [Sound Library](https://frscharity.org/Water_and_Ice/) organised by the Field Recording Slack group. The library is available in return for donations to Doctors Without Borders, The Red Cross and Unicef.


It's also great fun to find and record unusual objects, and I'm always on the hunt for things that produce interesting tones and textures.

These sounds make ideal source material that can be combined and further manipulated using software.

A few summers ago my friend and collaborator [Josh Foers](https://www.joshfoersgameaudio.co.uk/) and I had the unique oportunity to record in a craft brewery here in Sheffield. As you can hear, we managed to capture some excellent material which we have both made use of in various projects since.

We've continued to record in some great locations together, such as the historic Braime metal factory in Leeds.

I use a range of mics for different situations, but more often than not I reach for my trusty hand-held Sony D100. Simply put, it's convenient and sounds amazing. The only thing i wish it had is external XLR inputs, but you can't have everything..and I'm lucky to have one since they're now discontinued and quite hard to find.

It is my belief that the best tools are ones most convenient to use. The reduced setup time of a handheld compared to more elaborate setups means you're less likely to miss those fleeting but golden recording oportunities..
